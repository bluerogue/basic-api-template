{"name":"Basic Java REST API Template","tagline":"Basic Java REST API template using Jersey, Spring 4, and Maven","body":"# Basic Java API Template\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is configured to deploy in a Tomcat servlet container, but can easily be used in other application servers with very little modification.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is built in the Eclipse IDE and the various configuration files are included for import and/or reference (since this is to serve as a project template after all). In general, the .classpath and .project files along with the .settings directory are unnecessary. A war file is also available in the target directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n## To Run:\r\n\r\nYou will need Tomcat7 and Maven.\r\n\r\nFrom the project root, run:<br>\r\n`mvn tomcat7:deploy -e`<br>\r\nor to redeploy:<br>\r\n`mvn tomcat7:redeploy -e`<br>\r\n\r\n## Notes:\r\n\r\nThis application expects a Tomcat user:pass of `admin:admin` for deployment. This can easily be changed in the `pom.xml` to meet your needs.\t\r\n\r\n\r\nThe default application context is:<br>\r\n[http://localhost:8080/api-template/](http://localhost:8080/api-template/)<br>\r\nand you can test the API at:<br>\r\n[http://localhost:8080/api-template/1.0/api?email=apiuser@test.com](http://localhost:8080/api-template/1.0/api?email=apiuser@test.com)<br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe default user:pass to access the API over http is `api:api`.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Auth is set up for this API application and can be found in `securityContext.xml`.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso note that `jdbc.properties` is placed in the classes directory and preconfigured code is commented out in `applicationContext.xml` to help you easily connect to a database.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew","google":"UA-49658042-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
