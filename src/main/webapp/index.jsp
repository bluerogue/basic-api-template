<h1>Basic API Template</h1>
<p>This is a simple API template project that combines Jersey, the JAX-RS reference implementation, and version 4.0 or the Spring framework. While the project was constructed using the Eclipse IDE, it should work properly in any environment, though it requires Maven to build.</p>
<p>This project is released under an MIT license. That is to say, you can basically do with it as you will.</p>
